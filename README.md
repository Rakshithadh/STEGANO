STEGANOGRAPHY
Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another message or object to avoid detection , can be used to hide virtually any type of digital content, including text, image, video or audio content . 
That hidden data is then extracted at its destination
Steganography refers to a concept rather than to an algorithm that is involved in the manipulation of visual images which are seen as binary grayscale pixels. 
Data or messages can be hidden within a picture in the form of grey scales. Recovering such crucial details out of a picture refers to cryptography. It is the method used by an attacker which also decides upon the security of steganography.
